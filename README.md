## Constrained categories

Experimenting (again) with constrained categories, as well as Haskell to hardware, automatic differentiation, interval analysis, and other interpretations. See the paper [*Compiling to categories*](http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories).

To run:

    stack build :examples

There are several more commented-out examples in test/Examples.hs.
You can fiddle with comments to change the collection of examples compiled.
That module also serves as an example to copy and make your own examples.

## Some applications

Working:

*   Circuit graphs
*   Automatic differentiation
*   GLSL for graphics
*   Interval analysis
*   Incremental computation
*   SMT (satisfy modulo theories), with John Wiegley

In progress:

*   Polynomials
*   Demand analysis for strictness.
*   Functions with some special cases like constant, linear, polynomial, as well as the general case

Others:

*   Something about language recognition, such as regular languages
*   Various semirings, including shortest/longest paths
*   Probabilistic programming and other wrappings of monadic interfaces
*   Memoization at every stage. With what benefit?
*   AFRP
